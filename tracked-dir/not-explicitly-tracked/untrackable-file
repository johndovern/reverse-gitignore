this file cannot be tracked (at least not without the use of the -f falg)
despite the .gitignore file in the current directory, not-explicitly-tracked/,
including it to be tracked. the .gitignore file in the parent directory,
tracked-dir/, does not list the current directory as being tracked. because of
that no files in the current directory, are trackable without the use of the -f
flag. notice that in the .gitignore file of the parent directory there is no
"*" character. this does not matter as the root directory of this repo
containes a .gitignore file with that character. the asterisk in a .gitignore
file tells git to ignore every file in the current directory and in all
subdirectories. as it is found in the .gitignore file of the root directory
everything to be tracked must be explicitly listed in a .gitignore file. either
as an absolute path or one relative to the current directory. i prefer to have
many .gitignore files in all the directories i am actively tracking. this lets
me see quickly what files and directories are being tracked in a readable
manner. using a single .gitignore file in the root directory with absolute
paths to the files i want to track is unreadable. this may all seem cumbersome
but i truly think this provides a nice layer of security from my greatest
enemy, myself who likes to do stupid things like run [ $ git add . ] in my home
directory. with this i can do that safely.
